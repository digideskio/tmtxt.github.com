- So... You don't blog very regularly recently.
- Hmm, I don't have enough time!
- Too busy on work?
- Nope, just enjoying the fun of the youth that I have missed for years :D

But...

I waste a lot of time without actually doing any useful thing, mostly in waiting time, e.g waiting to my gf to be ready, waiting for my friends to come for a coffee or any other kind of waiting. I started to think about blogging on the go. However, the only thing that I have in thoses cases is my smart phone, an iOS powered one. And dealing with all those jekyll and git stuffs on a smartphone is really a big challenge.

Let's make the impossible become real.

#  First obstacle: Git, of course

Coming from the terminal and Emacs world, I have never imagined how I would deal with git without them. But now I do :D

[Working copy](https://appsto.re/vn/xONC1.i) by Anders Borum is a quite good choice. You have the option to pay $14.99 in order to unlock the push feature. Actually, you **have to** pay. Who can use git without push feature :LOL:

For me, this's quite adequate. All the steps to clone and push from Github are set up automatically, just input your credential and done. It just took me few minutes to get used to the UI. There are Git2Go with the same price, but I'm satisfy with this so will leave Git2Go for next chance.

# Markdown editor

[Byword](https://appsto.re/vn/bq7UC.i) seem to be the only option out there. Almost all the articles that I found on the internet refer this as the best option. With all the basic markdown features included, good looking font for editing and nice preview mode, it's worth to spend $3.99 on (money again, and not the last one).

# Text Snippets and Navigation

Back to the old day when I was still using iPhone 3g with ios 4.2.1, the text navigation and snippet experience was awful compare to Android with its 3rd party keyboard. But for now, after years coming back from Android, I'm really impressed by what iOS can do now. You can install
