My developer life has been a long series of sitting days sticking with my computer. Until recently, when I do a regular health check, I discover that my body is facing some serious health issues. Luckily, they are all curable, pnothong fatal ðŸ˜…. The doctor reported that the cause is from my habit of sitting the whole long day and the lack of frequent exercises. That's quite the same for most of the IT guys. I then decided that it's time to change my working style, change to a more standing style than before.

# First thing, a standing desk

Yeah you know that, this helps you decrease the sitting time while letting you continue your work at the same time. This is also quite popular in many IT companies (and in my university, too). It's quite difficult to find the standing desk in Vietnam. There are not many models. The people here seems not very interested in working with a standing desk. The only solution that I found was this one, with the price around 2,3m VND, about $100, quit acceptable!

Yeah, why not turn up the music speaker volume and shake your body while standing? ðŸ˜†
