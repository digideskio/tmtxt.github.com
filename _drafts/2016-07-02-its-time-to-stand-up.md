My developer life has been a long series of sitting days sticking with my computer. Until recently, when I do a regular health check, I discover that my body is facing some serious health issues. Luckily, they are all curable, pnothong fatal ðŸ˜…. The doctor reported that the cause is from my habit of sitting the whole long day and the lack of frequent exercises. That's quite the same for most of the IT guys. I then decided that it's time to change my working style, change to a more standing style than before.
