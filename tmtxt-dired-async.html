	<h1>1. Asynchoronous execution library for Emacs Dired</h1>
	<p>
	  A library for Emacs Dired mode to copy, compress, decompress files
	  asynchronously. It also provides the ability to mark files in multiple
	  directories and then copy all of them into a destination library. This
	  library is designed for Unix-based system like MacOS, Ubuntu,... The
	  reason why I developed this library is to overcome Emacs Dired's
	  drawbacks. Everytime I need to copy, move, compress, uncompress,... big
	  files, Emacs is blocked until those processes finish execution. That's
	  really annoying. This extension helps solve that problem by providing
	  Emacs with the ability to asynchronously execute those tasks as well as
	  display the output to the user.
	</p>

	<h1>3. Features</h1>
	You don't have to follow the key bindings below, you can change them to
	whatever you want. They are just examples.

	<h2>3.1 Asynchronously Copy files</h2>
	This feature uses rsync for file copying. To use it, simply mark the files
that you want and then activate this function.
{% highlight cl %}
(define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-r") 'tmtxt/dired-async-rsync)
{% endhighlight %}

	<h2>3.2 Asynchronously Compress files</h2>
	Compress all marked files.
{% highlight cl %}
(define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-z") 'tmtxt/dired-async-zip)
{% endhighlight %}

	<h2>3.3 Asynchronously Decompress files</h2>
	Decompress the zip file at point.
{% highlight cl %}
(define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-u") 'tmtxt/dired-async-unzip)
{% endhighlight %}

	<h2>3.4 Copy from multiple directories</h2>
	This feature allows you to select many files from multi directories and then
copy all of them to a destination folder.
{% highlight cl %}
(define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-a") 'tmtxt/dired-async-rsync-multiple-mark-file)
(define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-e") 'tmtxt/dired-async-rsync-multiple-empty-list)
(define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-d") 'tmtxt/dired-async-rsync-multiple-remove-item)
(define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-v") 'tmtxt/dired-async-rsync-multiple)
{% endhighlight %}
	C-c C-a to add the file at point to the list for later copy. C-c C-d to
remove the current file at point from the waiting list. C-c C-e to empty the
waiting list. Finally, C-c C-v to copy all files in the list to the current
directory.
