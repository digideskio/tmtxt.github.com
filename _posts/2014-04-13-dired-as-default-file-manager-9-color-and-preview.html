<p>
  <strong>Dired rainbow</strong> is an extension for Dired that helps you to
  colorize file names in Dired depending on the file types. You can install the
  package using
  <a href="{%post_url 2013-01-07-emacs-package-manager%}">
    package.el
  </a>.
  The steps is really easy, just define the file extensions group and the color
  you want for that group. For example
</p>

{% highlight cl%}
(require 'dired-rainbow)

(defconst dired-audio-files-extensions
  '("mp3" "MP3" "ogg" "OGG" "flac" "FLAC" "wav" "WAV")
  "Dired Audio files extensions")
(dired-rainbow-define audio "#329EE8" dired-audio-files-extensions)

(defconst dired-video-files-extensions
    '("vob" "VOB" "mkv" "MKV" "mpe" "mpg" "MPG" "mp4" "MP4" "ts" "TS" "m2ts"
      "M2TS" "avi" "AVI" "mov" "MOV" "wmv" "asf" "m2v" "m4v" "mpeg" "MPEG" "tp")
    "Dired Video files extensions")
(dired-rainbow-define video "#B3CCFF" dired-video-files-extensions)

<h1 id="image-preview-with-helm">
  Image Preview with Helm
</h1>

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm">Helm</a>
  <strong>follow-mode</strong> makes it possible for browsing images in one
  window with the preview in another window. Again, you can use
  <a href="{%post_url 2013-01-07-emacs-package-manager%}">
    package.el
  </a> to install helm without any difficulty. Helm
  <strong>follow-mode</strong> uses image-dired in the background, so if
  image-dired doesn't work for some reason, this will not work too. Be sure to
  have <strong>Imagemagick</strong> package installed.
</p>

<p>
  However, what helm follow-mode do with the image preview is to open the image
  inside Emacs so it is a bit slow. On modern computer with high speed CPU and
  SSD, this should not be a big problem
</p>

<p>
  Make sure you have helm installed and activated, add this to your .emacs to
  turn on
  <strong>image-dired-display-image-mode</strong>
  by default.
</p>

{% highlight cl%}
(image-dired-display-image-mode)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Now navigate your dired buffer to your image folder and call
  <strong>helm-find-files</strong>.
  After that, type
  <strong>C-c C-f</strong> to turn on helm
  <strong>follow-mode</strong>. The images will now be previewed in other window.
