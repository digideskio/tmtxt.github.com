# Keyboard is programmer's best friend

The two very basic input devices that we use everyday to interact with our
computer are keyboard and mouse. As a programmer, I found that mouse is the most
annoying peripheral for me. You may agree with me or may not but in fact it slows
down the programmer's everyday work a lot because you have to move your hand
between your keyboard and mouse regularly.

There are two solutions for this problem.

* Keep your left hand always on the keyboard and your right hand always on your
  mouse (assume that right-handed person).
* Keep both your hand on the keyboard and try not to use your mouse as much as
  possible

Because we are programmers and our work mainly is to type code, I prefer and
recommend the second solution. Now you understand what I mean by **keyboard hero**.
;) Try to exploit your keyboard as much as possible and become a master in using
it and the purpose of this article is to encourage you to learn how to use your
keyboard effeciently.

Amazingly, for programmers, most of our work can be done using the keyboard
instead of mouse and more even, it can be done in a better way using keyboard
compare to using mouse. It's an extremely powerful tool to help you archive from
the most basic tasks like file management, compose mail,... to those advanced
tasks.

# Recommended solutions

**Operating System**: Unix-based OS (Linux, MacOS,...)  
**Text editor**: Emacs, Vim  
**Web browser**: Conkeror, Vimium for Chrome  
**Command Line**: Terminal with Zshell  

Actually, Emacs and Vim are the two most powerful text editors but they can do
more than that. They can act as a file management, irc chat client, programming
environment, mail client,... In term of Web browser, Conkeror is suitable for
people who are Emacs-interested and Vimium for those who are familiar with Vim.
However, Conkeror is much more powerful and customizable. Also, you need to get
used to command line applications via terminal. And to get those stuffs done,
you will need a powerful platform for it, that is an Unix-based OS such as
Linux, MacOS,... not Windows.

Also, another good solution is to master the keyboard shortcuts. It can be
difficult at the beginning. Don't give up! Moreover, on MacOS, you can even set
keyboard shortcut for nearly all applications using a built-in functionality. If
you know any similar feature or application on linux, please comment to this
post to share with the others.

# Summary

Let me repeat it again. Keyboard is programmer's best friend. Learn how to
exploit your keyboard and dominate it. Try to make it serve you not you to
follow it.

**And then you become a keyboard hero** ;)
