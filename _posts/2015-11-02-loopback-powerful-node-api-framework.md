It’s needless to mention the growing popularity of Node.js for application
development. eBay has been running a production Node API service since 2011.
PayPal is actively rebuilding their front-end in Node. Walmart’s mobile site has
become the biggest Node application, traffic wise. On Thanksgiving weekend in
2014,
[Walmart servers processed 1.5 billion requests](http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/02/walmart-com-reports-biggest-cyber-monday-in-history-mobile-traffic-at-70-over-the-holidays/),
70 percent of which were
delivered through mobile and powered by Node.js. On the development side, the
Node package manager ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)) continues to grow rapidly,
recently surpassing 150,000 hosted modules.

While Ruby has Rails and Python has Django, the dominant application development
framework for Node has yet to be established. But, there is a powerful contender
gaining steam: [LoopBack](http://loopback.io/), an open source API framework
built by San Mateo,
Calif., company [StrongLoop](https://strongloop.com/).
StrongLoop is an important contributor to the latest
[Node version](https://nodejs.org/), not to mention the
[current maintainers](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/tj-holowaychuk-sponsorship-of-express/ )
of [Express](http://expressjs.com/ ), one of the most popular Node frameworks in
existence.

Let’s take a closer look at LoopBack and it’s capabilities by turning everything
into practice and building an example application.
