<p>
  Wdired is a special mode that allows you to perform file operations by editing
the Dired buffer directly (the “W” in “Wdired” stands for “writable”.). Imagine
that you want to rename multiple files, you will have to call the rename command
several times. Wdired help you to transform the current dired buffer to an
editable one, then you can change multiple file names and apply the changes. To
  activate it, simply run the command <b>dired-toggle-read-only</b> (bound to <b>C-x C-q</b>
  by default). When you finish, just call <b>wdired-finish-edit</b> (<b>C-c C-c</b>) to commit the
  changes or <b>wdired-abort-changes</b> (<b>C-c C-k</b>) to cancel.
</p>

<p>
  This is much faster comparing to the other GUI file managers. However, it's
still not very convenience since you still have to mark the text that you want
to change. Also, in normal file manager, when you rename one file, it will auto
select the file name exclude the extension for you to edit. This can be achieved
easily using a little emacs lisp.

<p>
  Here I defined some functions for fast file name marking. The first one marks
the file name on current line. The next one moves the point to next line and
marks the file name while the last function does the opposite. Next, you need to
bind key for those functions, for example
</p>


{% highlight cl %}
(eval-after-load 'wdired
  (define-key wdired-mode-map (kbd "TAB") 'my-mark-file-name-forward)
  (define-key wdired-mode-map (kbd "S-<tab>") 'my-mark-file-name-backward)
  (define-key wdired-mode-map (kbd "s-a") 'my-mark-file-name-for-rename))
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
    <b>Usuage</b>: when entering wdired mode, pressing TAB will mark the next file for
renaming, type a new name and continue pressing TAB to move to next file. The
file name is automatically selected for you to replace. Shift-tab will do the
opposite while s-a mark the current file. After the mark is activate, if you
    want to mark all file name (include the extension), just press <b>C-e</b>
(move-end-of-line). See the video below for demonstration
